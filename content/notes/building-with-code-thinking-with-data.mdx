excerpt: "Code is how I build. Data is how I decide. I try to keep the two in the same loop."

I build software, but I do not trust software without feedback. Data keeps me honest. It shows what actually happens, not what I assume.

## The loop I aim for

1. Build a small, testable feature.
2. Measure what it changes.
3. Adjust based on the results, not the hype.

## Where this helps

- Product decisions stay grounded.
- Automation does not drift.
- Metrics become tools, not vanity.

Code is the tool. Data is the lens. I need both.
