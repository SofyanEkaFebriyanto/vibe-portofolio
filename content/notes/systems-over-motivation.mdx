Motivation is unreliable. It spikes and crashes. Systems are quieter, but they keep work moving when energy is low.

## What I consider a system

A system is a small set of defaults: a schedule, a checklist, a template, or a habit that reduces decision fatigue. It should be easy to maintain and obvious to follow.

## What I avoid

- Over-planning without execution.
- Tools that promise everything but require constant setup.
- Busywork disguised as progress.

Systems do not remove creativity. They protect it.
