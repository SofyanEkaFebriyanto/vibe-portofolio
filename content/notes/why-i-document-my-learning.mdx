excerpt: "Documentation slows me down just enough to catch flawed assumptions. It also turns private progress into shared context."

I started documenting because I kept re-learning the same lessons. Notes made the feedback loop visible. When I write down what changed, I can trace how decisions were made and why they worked or failed.

## What changes with documentation

- I notice patterns earlier, especially in mistakes.
- I can compare current decisions with older ones instead of relying on memory.
- I stop pretending progress is linear. Notes show the messy parts.

## How I keep it useful

I keep notes short. If a note cannot be read in under five minutes, it is probably two notes. I also record the trigger: what problem or question started the learning. That makes future search easier.

Documentation is not a highlight reel. It is a workbench.
